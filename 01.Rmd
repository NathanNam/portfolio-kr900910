## Need for robo-pastor.
<!-- can you characterize the need in the heading? -->
Many Christians try to make ethical decisions based on their interpretations of the Bible. Some have the right educational and social backgrounds to make such decisions themselves, but most seek the advice of pastors. However, not all pastors have the same view on one thing, and people might get conflicting answers from different pastors which makes decision making more difficult. Also, people cannot talk to pastors about every daily decision they make. If a machine can aggregate different biblical interpretations available online and provide advice for a given issue with proper references to the Bible, the machine can be a robo-pastor and help Christians make ethical decisions.

## NLP for robo-pastor.

The robo-pastor will be a bot that uses machine learning techniques and natural language processing. An input to the robo-pastor will be a question like, "Should I love my neighbor?". The robo-pastor will generate three outputs. The first is a verse or a chapter from the Bible that is the most relevant to the question asked.<!-- How will you measure relevance? --> For the above question, this first output might look like, "Love your neighbor as yourself (Mark 12:31)". The second output will be a percentage of interpretations that will say "Yes" to the question asked and the key sentence of "Yes" interpretations.<!-- Will they have to be yes/no questions? --> For the above example, this output will look like "98% Yes - God wants you to love your neighbor". The last output will be similar to the second output, but it will be for "No". This output for our example will look like "2% No â€“ it's okay to hate your neighbor".

To generate the outputs from the given question, the robo-pastor will first select keywords from the question.<!-- You probably won't have to do this. --> For our example, the keywords will be "love" and "neighbor". Then, the robo-pastor will look for the most relevant verse or chapter from the Bible using these keywords. Once such verse or chapter is found, the robo-pastor will look online<!-- You'll need a database. --> for interpretations which mention the selected verse or chapter. For each interpretation found, the robo-pastor will summarize it in one sentence and tag the sentence as "Yes" or "No" based on its relationship to the keywords we first selected. Then, the robo-pastor will calculate "Yes" and "No" percentages and select key sentences for "Yes" and "No" which best summarize each answer.

## Next steps for robo-pastor.

As described above, the robo-pastor summarizes different biblical interpretations on a given issue in a simple "Yes/No" output with a specific reference to the Bible, and this will help Christians make faster ethical decisions without having to rely on one source of interpretation. However, there is a very obvious limitation for the robo-pastor: a simple "Yes" or "No" answer might not be the correct answer for the given user. If the robo-pastor can understand different situations of a user and make more intricate advice, it will truly help Christians make better ethical decisions and bring the Second Reformation in our history.
