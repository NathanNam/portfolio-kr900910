I’m Seung, and this is my first data science portfolio website. Hope you enjoy my ideas and connect with me if you’re interested. Below is a short clip of myself talking about my hypothetical client (investor). Even though my ideas in this website are not directly related to finance, I’m planning to leverage my data science ideas to achieve what I’m describing in this video. Figure 2: Hello Seung! Abstract of my first cool idea My first idea is about helping Christians make better ethical decisions by aggregating Biblical interpretation data. I have seen cases for some Christians where talking directly to pastors to answer ethical questions is limited, and I would like to provide a way for them to find out how different people interpret a specific part of the Bible to answer a certain ethical question. The solution will use natural language processing to find a Bible verse or chapter relevant to a question and summarize how different people interpret the part of the Bible in the context of the question by providing some distribution of different interpretations. Abstract of my second cool idea My second idea is about reducing frustration of interviewees waiting for interview results by analyzing interview recording data and providing a way to calculate probability of getting an offer. Everyone at some point has experienced the pain of waiting for interview result, and I would like to relieve some of the pain to improve overall interview experience for job seekers. The solution will extract different features from interview recording data such as number of pauses, frequency of certain words, or vibration level of interviewee voice and use supervised machine learning method such as neural network or random forest to predict probability of getting an offer. About the author I’m currently working as a financial engineer at a company called Moody’s Analytics building financial models for structured finance securities. I have a background in statistics, and I’m currently enrolled in Master of Information and Data Science program at UC Berkeley. I have extensive experience in financial modeling, data analysis, and programming, and I would like to apply data science techiniques in finance. Eventually, I’d like to leverage my experience in finance and data science to create my own AI/ML hedge fund! Updated: 2017-11-21 "],
["robo-pastor.html", "Can Machines Help Christians Make Ethical Decisions? Need for robo-pastor. NLP for robo-pastor. Next steps for robo-pastor.", " Can Machines Help Christians Make Ethical Decisions? Keywords robo-pastor, NLP, Second Reformation Need for robo-pastor. Many Christians try to make ethical decisions based on their interpretations of the Bible, and some of them have right educational and social backgrounds to make such decisions themselves while a lot of Christians seek for advice of others like pastors. However, not all pastors have the same view on one thing, and people might get conflicting answers from different pastors which make decision making process more difficult. Also, people cannot talk to pastors about every daily decision they make while the need for biblical decision making remains. If a machine can aggregate different biblical interpretations available online and provide advice for a given issue with proper reference to the Bible, the machine can be a robo-pastor and help Christians make ethical decisions. NLP for robo-pastor. The robo-pastor will be a robot which will heavily use machine learning techniques and natural language processing. An input to the robo-pastor will be a question like “should I love my neighbor?” The robo-pastor will generate three outputs. The first is a verse or a chapter from the Bible that is the most relevant to the question asked. For the above question, this first output might look like “Love your neighbor as yourself (Mark 12:31)”. The second output will be a percentage of interpretations that will say “Yes” to the question asked and the key sentence of “Yes” interpretations. For the above example, this output will look like “98% Yes - God wants you to love your neighbor”. The last output will be similar to the second output, but it will be for “No”. This output for our example will look like “2% No – it’s okay to hate your neighbor”. Image Source Source: Grace Central Coast To generate the outputs from the given question, the robo-pastor will first select keywords from the question. For our example, the keywords will be “love” and “neighbor”. Then, the robo-pastor will look for the most relevant verse or chapter from the Bible using these keywords. Once such verse or chapter is found, the robo-pastor will look online for interpretations which mention the selected verse/chapter. For each interpretation found, the robo-pastor will summarize it in one sentence and tag the sentence as “Yes” or “No” based on its relationship to the keywords we first selected. Then, the robo-pastor will calculate “Yes” and “No” percentages and select key sentences for “Yes” and “No” which best summarize each answer. Next steps for robo-pastor. As described above, the robo-pastor summarizes different biblical interpretations on a given issue in a simple “Yes”/”No” output with a specific reference to the Bible, and this will help Christians make faster ethical decisions without having to rely on one source of interpretation. However, there is a very obvious limitation for the robo-pastor: a simple “Yes” or “No” answer might not be the correct answer for the given user. If the robo-pastor can understand different situations of a user and make more intricate advice, it will truly help Christians make better ethical decisions and bring the Second Reformation in our history.

["interview-prediction.html", "Predicting Interview Result Using Sound Data Post-Interview Frustration. Prediction Using Interview Recording. Better Interview Experience.", " Predicting Interview Result Using Sound Data Keywords interview, supervised learning, sound data, prediction Post-Interview Frustration. Most of interviewees should have asked themselves this question after an interview: “Did I do well during the interview?” Some companies let you know the interview result right away, but most of companies take at least a few days or even longer to respond to interviewees who often become frustrated waiting for the result. If there is a way to predict interview result based on conversation made during interview, it will relieve interviewees’ frustration during the waiting period and help them emotionally prepared for the interview result. Prediction Using Interview Recording. One way to predict interview result is using machine learning methods and interview audio recording data. The basic idea is to identify different features from sound data and to use supervised learning to predict interview result. To train a machine learning model, sufficient amount of recording data should be collected. To achieve this, a sample of job seekers will be selected from LinkedIn, and they will be asked to record their interviews and report interview results. Once data is available, different features of sound data should be identified. For example, these features might include number of pauses, specific words used by interviewers, vibration level of interviewee’s voice, etc. After features are identified, sound data will be processed and loaded into database with the identified features and interview results (Offer/No Offer) as columns and collected samples as rows. This data set will be then divided into training set and test set, and supervised learning methods such as logistic regression or decision tree will be used to create a model with job offer probability as output. Once the model is trained and tested, a website can be created for interviewees to upload their interview sound recording and see the prediction result along with analysis of different features. Once the interviewees find out actual interview result, they will be asked to submit the result which will then be used to update the prediction model along with the originally uploaded recording. Better Interview Experience. The solution described above will not only reduce post-interview frustration for interviewees but also help them identify the aspects of interviews that can be improved by providing analysis of different features. They can also perform practice interviews and analyze how certain changes can increase or decrease job offer probability. It will be challenging to collect interview recording data mainly because of company compliance rules. However, if we can provide some analytics to companies as well as interviewees and collect data through secured app to prevent data leakage issue, companies might be willing to record during interviews and help improve the prediction model results. The solution described will not completely free interviewees from frustration in uncertainty, but this will help improve overall interview experience for many job seekers by providing insights from interview data.
