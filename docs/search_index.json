I’m Seung, and this is my first data science portfolio website. Hope you enjoy my ideas and connect with me if you’re interested. Below is a short video describing my first idea (#robo-pastor) and why you need to join me to expand this concept! Figure .: Hello Seung! Abstract of my first cool idea My first idea is about helping Christians make better ethical decisions by aggregating Biblical interpretation data. I have seen cases for some Christians where talking directly to pastors to answer ethical questions is limited, and I would like to provide a way for them to find out how different people interpret the Bible to answer a certain ethical question. The solution will use natural language processing to find a Bible verse or chapter relevant to a question, and it will summarize how different people interpret the Bible in the context of the question by providing a distribution of different interpretations. Abstract of my second cool idea My second idea is about reducing frustration of interviewees waiting for interview results by analyzing interview recording data and providing a way to calculate probability of getting an offer. Everyone at some point has experienced the pain of waiting for interview result, and I would like to relieve some of this pain to improve overall interview experience for job seekers. The solution will extract different features from interview recording data such as number of pauses, frequency of certain words, or vibration level of interviewee voice and use supervised machine learning methods such as neural network or random forest to predict probability of getting an offer. About the author I’m currently working as a financial engineer at a company called Moody’s Analytics building financial models for structured finance securities. I have a background in statistics, and I’m currently enrolled in Master of Information and Data Science program at UC Berkeley School of Information. I have extensive experience in financial modeling, data analysis, and programming, and I would like to apply data science techiniques in finance and eventually create my own AI/ML hedge fund!

Keywords robo-pastor, Biblical interpretation, NLP, summarization 1.1 Need to avoid biased Biblical interpretations Many Christians try to make ethical decisions based on their interpretations of the Bible. Some have the right educational and social backgrounds to make such decisions themselves, but most seek the advice of pastors. However, there are some cases where relying completely on one pastor’s interpretation to answer ethical questions is undesirable or even dangerous. For example, consider a gay Christian teenager boy who wants to know what the Bible says about his sexuality. If a pastor at his church is homophobic, listening to such pastor’s Biblical interpretation about homosexuality might be devastating to the boy, and it can even make him leave Christianity. Since a specific Biblical interpretation can have a profound impact on Christians’ lives, Christians need an efficient way to summarize how different people interpret the Bible for a given ethical question to avoid biased interpretations. If a machine can aggregate different biblical interpretations available online and provide advice for a given issue with proper references to the Bible, the machine can be a robo-pastor and help Christians make better ethical decisions. 1.2 Using NLP for robo-pastor The robo-pastor will be a bot that uses machine learning techniques and natural language processing. An input to the robo-pastor will be a yes/no question like, “Should I love my neighbor?”. The robo-pastor will generate three outputs. The first is a verse or a chapter from the Bible that is the most relevant to the question asked. For the above question, this first output might look like, “Love your neighbor as yourself (Mark 12:31)”. The second output will be a percentage of interpretations that will say “Yes” to the question asked and the key sentence of “Yes” interpretations. For the above example, this output will look like “98% Yes - God wants you to love your neighbor”. The last output will be similar to the second output, but it will be for “No”. This output for our example will look like “2% No – it’s okay to hate your neighbor”. Figure 1.1: System Architecture Diagram To generate outputs from a given question, the robo-pastor will use the input question to find out a relevant topic from pre-defined topic list. For our example, the topic will be “love neighbor”. Then, the robo-pastor will look for the most relevant verse or chapter from the Bible tagged with the given topic. Once such verse or chapter is found, the robo-pastor will look in the database to find out interpretations tagged with the selected verse or chapter. For each interpretation found, the robo-pastor will summarize it in one sentence and tag the sentence as “Yes” or “No” based on its relationship to the topic defined. Then, the robo-pastor will calculate “Yes” and “No” percentages and select key sentences for “Yes” and “No” which best summarize each answer. 1.3 True purpose of robo-pastor As described above, the robo-pastor summarizes different biblical interpretations on a given issue in a simple “Yes/No” output with a specific reference to the Bible, and this will help Christians make faster ethical decisions without having to rely on one source of interpretation. However, there is a very obvious limitation for the robo-pastor: a simple “Yes” or “No” answer might not be the correct answer for the given user. Also, for many Christians, the concept of robo-pastor will sound weird or even distasteful. However, the purpose of robo-pastor is not replacing human pastors who can provide more than “Yes/No” answer. Its true purpose is to supplement Christians with a little bit more diverse interpretations so that they are not stuck with one-sided interpretation from their human pastors. "],
["interview-prediction.html", "2 Predicting Interview Result Using Sound Data 2.1 Post-Interview Frustration 2.2 Prediction Using Interview Recording 2.3 Better Interview Experience", " 2 Predicting Interview Result Using Sound Data Keywords interview, supervised learning, sound data, prediction 2.1 Post-Interview Frustration Most of interviewees should have asked themselves this question after an interview: “Did I do well during the interview?” Some companies let you know the interview result right away, but most of companies take at least a few days or even longer to respond to interviewees who often become frustrated waiting for the result. If there is a way to predict interview result based on conversation made during interview, it will relieve interviewees’ frustration during the waiting period and help them emotionally prepared for the interview result. 2.2 Prediction Using Interview Recording One way to predict interview result is using machine learning methods and interview audio recording data. The basic idea is to identify different features from sound data and to use supervised learning to predict interview result. To train a machine learning model, sufficient amount of recording data should be collected. To achieve this, a sample of job seekers will be selected from LinkedIn, and they will be asked to record their interviews and report interview results. Once data is available, different features of sound data should be identified. For example, these features might include number of pauses, specific words used by interviewers, vibration level of interviewee’s voice, etc. After features are identified, sound data will be processed and loaded into database with the identified features and interview results (Offer/No Offer) as columns and collected samples as rows. This data set will be then divided into training set and test set, and supervised learning methods such as logistic regression or decision tree will be used to create a model with job offer probability as output. Once the model is trained and tested, a website can be created for interviewees to upload their interview sound recording and see the prediction result along with analysis of different features. Once the interviewees find out actual interview result, they will be asked to submit the result which will then be used to update the prediction model along with the originally uploaded recording. 2.3 Better Interview Experience The solution described above will not only reduce post-interview frustration for interviewees but also help them identify the aspects of interviews that can be improved by providing analysis of different features. They can also perform practice interviews and analyze how certain changes can increase or decrease job offer probability. It will be challenging to collect interview recording data mainly because of company compliance rules. However, if we can provide some analytics to companies as well as interviewees and collect data through secured app to prevent data leakage issue, companies might be willing to record during interviews and help improve the prediction model results. The solution described will not completely free interviewees from frustration in uncertainty, but this will help improve overall interview experience for many job seekers by providing insights from interview data.
