Hello everyone! I'm Seung, and this is my first data science portfolio website. Hope you enjoy my ideas and connect with me if you're interested. Below is a short clip of myself talking about my hypothetical client (investor). Even though my ideas in this website are not directly related to finance, I'm planning to leverage my data science ideas to achieve what I'm describing in this video.

### Abstract of my first cool idea

My first idea is about helping Christians make better ethical decisions by aggregating Biblical interpretation data. I have seen cases for some Christians where talking directly to pastors to answer ethical questions is limited, and I would like to provide a way for them  to find out how different people interpret a specific part of the Bible to answer a certain ethical question. The solution will use natural language processing to find a Bible verse or chapter relevant to a question and summarize how different people interpret the part of the Bible in the context of the question by providing some distribution of different interpretations.

### Abstract of my second cool idea

My second idea is about reducing frustration of interviewees waiting for interview results by analyzing interview recording data and providing a way to calculate probability of getting an offer. Everyone at some point has experienced the pain of waiting for interview result, and I would like to relieve some of the pain to improve overall interview experience for job seekers. The solution will extract different features from interview recording data such as number of pauses, frequency of certain words, or vibration level of interviewee voice and use supervised machine learning method such as neural network or random forest to predict probability of getting an offer.

## About the author

I'm currently working as a financial engineer at a company called Moody's Analytics building financial models for structured finance securities. I have a background in statistics, and I'm currently enrolled in Master of Information and Data Science program at UC Berkeley. I have extensive experience in financial modeling, data analysis, and programming, and I would like to apply data science techiniques in finance. Eventually, I'd like to leverage my experience in finance and data science to create my own AI/ML hedge fund!
