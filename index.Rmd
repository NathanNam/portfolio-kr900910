### Abstract of my first cool idea

My first idea is about helping Christians make better ethical decisions by aggregating Biblical interpretation data. I have seen cases for some Christians where talking directly to pastors to answer ethical questions is limited, and I would like to provide a way for them  to find out how different people interpret a specific part of the Bible to answer a certain ethical question. The solution will use natural language processing to find a Bible verse or chapter relevant to a question and summarize how different people interpret the part of the Bible in the context of the question by providing some distribution of different interpretations.

### Abstract of my second cool idea

My second idea is about reducing frustration of interviewees waiting for interview results by analyzing interview recording data and providing a way to calculate probability of getting an offer. Everyone at some point has experienced the pain of waiting for interview result, and I would like to relieve some of the pain to improve overall interview experience for job seekers. The solution will extract different features from interview recording data such as number of pauses, frequency of certain words, or vibration level of interviewee voice and use supervised machine learning method such as neural network or random forest to predict probability of getting an offer.
